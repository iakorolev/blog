Hello! This post is about my past 3rd week.

On Monday I had two remote lectures!

On Wednesday I had 5 couples, between couples we had a window where I went to the dining room and ate a delicious burger.

On Thursday I had classes in discrete mathematics, programming technology and two lectures.

On Friday I have one lecture on computer algebra.

Thank you for your attention!).
