1. On Monday I went to the grocery store. I made a delicious julienne with mushrooms and chicken with cream.

2. On Tuesday I had a couple in physical education.

3. I have 5 pairs on Wednesday. Finished laboratory work No. 14.

4. On Thursday, couples on mathematical logic, programming technologies and a lecture on mathematical analysis.

This is all. Thank you for your attention!
