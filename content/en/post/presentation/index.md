# Introduction

This article is useful for managers, speakers, teachers and anyone who wants to be understood and heard. You'll learn how to choose a presentation tool, where to start, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to create a beautiful presentation, even if you're doing it for the first time.

# Formulate a topic

It is difficult to listen to an interlocutor who jumps from one to another, so the presentation should have only one topic. Otherwise, it will be a long story about nothing. The topic should be narrow enough to offer a solution to the problem at the end. Narrow the topic down until the presentation can be summed up in ten short paragraphs.

Determining a good topic is easy - it itself suggests the structure of the speech.

# Define a target

A good presentation changes the existing picture of the world. For example, people are starting to be more environmentally friendly or running after a new smartphone. The goal does not have to be ambitious, the main thing is specific.

A good presentation goal starts with the question: what do I want to change in the behavior of the listeners.

# Think of a scenario

The purpose of the presentation is what you want to change in the listener's head, and the script is how you will arrive at those changes.

Imagine that you are writing a story. The listener must be intrigued, come up with an interesting character, lead him through difficulties to a successful ending. This is the basic structure of any text and presentation. Fairy tales, film scripts and product advertisements are based on such a structure:

1. **Bring it up to date.** From the first slide, the viewer should understand what exactly he will receive or learn now. It is better to do without creativity, and directly indicate on the cover or the first slide what will happen next.

2. **Intrigue.** Create motivation so that the person does not leave the second slide. Explain the value of the presentation or create tension.

3. **Thesis.** This is the main motive of the presentation, what you want to teach people.

4. **Antithesis.** Show the other side of the coin. This inspires confidence and warns against problems that a person may encounter in practice.

5. **Conclusion.** A bad presentation ends with "that's it." Finally, give a short summary or conclusion. After your presentation, the person should understand what he can do right now.

# Alternate slides

Presentation is like text. If the text consists of sentences of the same length and the same type, it will be boring to read. There is no rhythm. Therefore, alternate text slides and slides with images, add graphics. Sometimes you can joke.

# Tell me what to do next

A bad performance ends like this: "That's it, now the questions." This way you leave the listener alone with his thoughts.

A good presentation gives clear instructions on what to do next. This is not necessarily a call to action. At the end, you can go over the conclusions again, emphasize the main thesis, or tell where to get additional information.

# Less colors

The presentation should have 1-2 primary colors. For example, for background, text and icons. Follow the chosen sequence and do not change colors unnecessarily. Choosing colors on your own is quite difficult, especially if you are not a designer. If you are making a corporate presentation, use corporate colors.

If there are no corporate colors, use color matching sites. There are ready-made combinations that are nice to look at.

# Less fonts

One font is enough to create a presentation. Take a modern sans-serif font: Open Sans, Roboto, PT Sans (these fonts are free to use). These are simple fonts that are easy to read. Checking this is easy: move away from the screen and try to read the title. If it's easy to read, you've guessed it. Accents can be done by changing the saturation of the font.

# Rule of thirds

This presentation rule helps you arrange the objects on the slide so that the eye immediately highlights the most important. Divide the slide into thirds lengthwise and across. Place significant objects at intersections. Significant objects are titles and illustrations.

# Texts are shorter

One slide, one thought. This slide is easy to read and remember. If you are speaking in public, he will keep the attention of the audience. How much text will be on the slide depends on the size of the audience. If a person is reading a presentation on the screen, a paragraph of text will not scare him. If you're speaking to an audience of 100 people, reading more than 10 words on a slide will be difficult.

# Add images

Photos and icons help reveal content, but should not replace it. If you find a beautiful photo "in the subject" that does not help to reveal the idea, do not use it.

# Make friends slides

In the presentation, all elements should be friends, that is, they should be of the same type. Then it is perceived easily, because it lives up to expectations.

Make several templates for each type of slide: a text slide, an image slide, a graph slide. Then just duplicate the slides and change only the text and images.

A presentation where the same type of elements occupy the same place on each slide looks neat.

# Tools to create an effective presentation

## powerpoint

Classic editor for creating presentations. Its simpler counterpart to Google Slides works online.

**Convenient:** Familiar editing interface. If you know how to handle Word, then you can handle PowerPoint. You can open a PowerPoint presentation using Google Drive. The program allows you to automate most of the actions, you just need to set up 2-3 templates, and then just copy styles and slides. Saves in pdf.

**Inconvenient:** too many tools inside that almost no one uses, the desired function can be difficult to find. To make a neat slide, you have to get used to and work hard.

## Keynote

A lighter version of PowerPoint for Macs.

**Convenient:** Only the necessary editing tools that you will definitely use. Unlike PowerPoint, you won't get lost in Keynote. Able to save the result in .pptx format, which will open on any computer. However, in this case, the slides and formatting can get a bit tricky.

**Inconvenient:** only works on Mac.

## Graphic editor

Photoshop, InDesign

**Convenient:** unlimited design possibilities

**Inconvenient:** require study. Unlike PowerPoint and Keynote, you can't open up Photoshop for the first time and make something beautiful right away. If you do not know how, you will need a designer.
