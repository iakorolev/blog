# Markdown

Markdown, or markdown, is a markup language for text documents. It allows you to create texts without using Word and other editors. The markup can be read and rendered on any system or browser.

Markdown was created by writer and blogger John Gruber along with web activist Aaron Schwartz. They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a “beautiful” look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers. Therefore, markdown is useful for everyone who deals with the web, from developers to bloggers.

# How to use the markup language

A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It's similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.

# Who uses the markdown

* Internet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup.

* Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown - they need a simple and reliable tool.

* Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages.

* Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion.

* Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup readable on any device.

* Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create flashcards.

# Why markdown is needed

* Quickly format an article to translate to PDF or just look nice with no extra effort.

* Layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML.

* Writing documentation for the code.

* Writing notes in a personal digital notebook.

# Markup rules

Basic syntax. It is very simple: the text is "wrapped" in characters or they are placed before the line.

In markdown, you can apply basic text formatting. You can’t insert a capital letter or handwritten font, but it’s easy to highlight important areas.

And if the text should contain an asterisk or any other “special” character that can be read wrong, you must put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the character will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.

# How to get started with markdown

It's very simple: you need to install or open any editor that supports this markup and start writing. There are local editors, they need to be downloaded, and there are those that work in the browser via the Internet, like a web service. Choose any, customize to your needs and get started. The syntax is simple and easy to learn. It may even be that you already partially use it: for example, the Telegram messenger uses markdown to format text.

If you want to use markdown not for personal notes, but for decorating text on a blog or website, you need to connect a Markdown-enabled plugin to them. This is also not difficult, such plugins exist for many CMS.

Markdown is also useful for those who are planning a career as a developer. It is needed in content, in web programming, in writing documentation. In professional courses, we talk in detail about this and other tools for different purposes.
