Hello! This post is about my past second week.

On Monday I had two remote lectures, and after them I went to classes in Russian. After class in Russian, I cooked the most delicious pilaf.

On Tuesday I had basketball lessons.

On Wednesday I had 5 pairs. Made a presentation and report on laboratory work No. 9.

On Tuesday I have 3 pairs. In the morning I made a presentation and removed the defense of the presentation on laboratory work No. 9.

On Friday I have a lecture on computer algebra. After couples, I ate very tasty buckwheat.

Thank you for your attention!).
