# Scientific programming languages.

In computer programming, a scientific programming language can refer to two powers of the same concept.

In a broad sense, a scientific programming language is a programming language that is widely used for computational science and computational mathematics. In this sense, C/C++ and Python can be considered scientific programming languages.

More broadly, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized to use mathematical formulas and matrices. Such languages are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this functionality is made available through the standard libraries. Scientific programming languages in a broader sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB, and R.

# C++ programming language

C++ is a compiled, statically typed, general purpose programming language.

Supports such programming paradigms as procedural programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming, provides modularity, separate compilation, exception handling, data abstraction, declaration of object types (classes), virtual functions. The standard library includes, among other things, commonly used containers and algorithms. C++ combines features of both high-level and low-level languages. In comparison with its predecessor, the C language, the greatest attention is paid to support for object-oriented and generic programming.

C++ is widely used for software development, being one of the most popular programming languages. Its scope includes the creation of operating systems, various application programs, device drivers, applications for embedded systems, high-performance servers, as well as entertainment applications. There are many implementations of the C++ language, both free and commercial, and for various platforms.

# Standard library

In the C++ programming language, the term Standard Library means a collection of classes and functions written in the base language. The Standard Library supports several main containers, functions for working with these containers, function objects, basic types of strings and streams (including interactive and file I/O), support for some language features, and commonly used functions for performing tasks such as , finding the square root of a number. The C++ Standard Library also includes the ISO C90 C Standard Library specifications. Functional features of the Standard Library are declared within the std namespace.

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a subset of the C++ Standard Library and contains containers, algorithms, iterators, function objects, and so on.

C++ Standard Library header files do not have the ".h" extension.

The C++ Standard Library contains the latest ANSI C++ extensions (including the Standard Template Library and the new iostream library). It is a set of header files.

# Differences from C

## New opportunities:

* Support for object-oriented programming;
* support for generic programming through templates;
* additional data types;
* exceptions;
* namespaces;
* embedded (inline) functions;
* operator overloading;
* function overload;
* references and operators for managing freely distributed memory;
* additions to the standard library.

## Not allowed in C++:

* call the main() function inside the program, while in C this action is legal.
* implicit type casting between unrelated pointer types.
* use functions that are not yet declared.

# Advantages and disadvantages

C++ is an evolutionary language. Each element of C++ was borrowed from other languages separately and independently of the other elements (nothing from the proposed C++ in the entire history of its development was an innovation in Computer Science), which made the language extremely complex, with many duplicate and mutually contradictory elements, blocks which are based on different formal bases.

Critics of C++ do not oppose it to any specific language, but rather argue that for any case of using C++, there is always an alternative toolkit that allows you to solve the same problem more efficiently and efficiently. In turn, C++ proponents consider it incorrect to compare various aspects of C++ with completely different languages, since the overall set of C++ features and capabilities is significantly wider than in most languages with which comparison is made, and the breadth of possibilities in itself , in their opinion, is a strong justification for the imperfection of each individual opportunity. Moreover, by in their opinion, high compatibility with C is one of the fundamental features of the language, and therefore all the shortcomings of C ++ are justified by the advantages provided by this compatibility.

## Advantages:

* High compatibility with C language
* Computing performance
* Support for various programming styles: structured, object-oriented, generic programming, functional programming, generative metaprogramming.
* Automatic calling of object destructors (in reverse order of constructors) simplifies and improves the reliability of memory management and other resources (open files, network connections, etc.).
* Operator overloading
* Templates (provide the ability to build generic containers and algorithms for different data types)
* Ability to extend the language to support paradigms that are not directly supported by compilers
* Availability. For C ++ there is a huge amount of educational literature translated into various languages

## Flaws:

* Poorly thought out syntax narrows the range of applicability of the language
* The language does not contain many important features
* Language contains dangerous features
* Labor productivity of language programmers is unreasonably low
* Cumbersome syntax
* Heavy Legacy
* The need to monitor memory
