GitHub is a web service based on the Git system. This is a social network for developers, which helps to conveniently conduct the collective development of IT projects. Here you can publish and edit your own code, comment on other people's developments, follow the news of other users.

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to revert to a particular version later. For file versioning, this book will use software source code as an example, although you can actually use versioning for just about any type of file.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to save every version of an image or layout (you most likely will), a version control system (hereinafter referred to as SLE) is exactly what you need. This allows you to revert files to the state they were in before changes were made, revert a project to its original state, view changes, find out who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using SLE also generally means that if you break something or lose files, you can fix it safely. In addition to everything, you will get all this without any additional effort.

Version control systems can be local, centralized, or distributed.

- The local system stores files on one device, the centralized system uses a shared server, and the distributed system uses shared cloud storage and team members' local devices. It is convenient to work with large projects on the local system, but it is difficult to interact with a remote team.
- Remote work is established in a centralized system, but everything is tied to one server. Any crash or hack can corrupt project files.
- In a distributed system, remote work has been established. If something happens to the files of the main repository, the project can be easily restored from a copy of any team member.

Git is a program that needs to be installed and connected to a project in order to manage version control. GitHub is a project version history repository site: you connect Git, register on GitHub, create an online repository, and transfer files from Git to GitHub.
Git is the most popular version control system and GitHub is an online code repository. Git and GitHub are designed to work together and are therefore often used as a single mechanism for working on a project.

If necessary, Git can be replaced by an alternative version control program, and GitHub can be replaced by another online code repository. Most employers don't need this because getting familiar with other services is time consuming and inconvenient for many developers.
